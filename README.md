* Count_Inversion - Given an array, return a number of pair (i,j) such that i<j and a[i]>a[j] in O(n)
* FindRank - It is a las vegas randamise algorithm to find rank of a number. Time complexity of the algorithm is on
              average O(n) 
* Next_greatest_element - Given a array, return a array containig index of element, with greater value and lesser index difference
