# Algorithms
* Count_Inversion - Given an array, return a number of pair (i,j) such that i<j and a[i]>a[j] in O(n)
* FindRank - It is a las vegas randamise algorithm to find rank of a number. Time complexity of the algorithm is on
              average O(n) 
* Next_greatest_element - Given a array, return a array containig index of element, with greater value and lesser index difference
* Rabin Karp - It is a pattern search algorithm of order O(n+m) where n,m : length of two strings
* Expression Evaluation - evaluates given mathematical expression using stacks
* Sieve Of Eratosthenes - Best Known algorithm to find all prime numbers Between 1 to n 
* Longest_Common_Substring - Given two strings, returns longest common substring with the help of rolling hash and Binary Search. Time complexity is O(nlogn)
* Merge Sort T(n) = O(nlogn)
* Quicksort  T(n) = O(nlogn)
