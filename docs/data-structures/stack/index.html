        <h1>What are Stacks ?</h1>
        <br>
        <img src="{{site.url}}/assets/stack.jpg" class="banner">

        <p> A stack is an linear data structure, commonly used in most of the programming languages. It follow a paticular
            order in which operations are performed. It allows adding and removing elements in a particular order. Every
            time a element is added it goes on the top of the stack, and only element that can be removed is the element
            that is at the top of the stack, just like a pile of objects.<br />
            Most common occurence of stack in programming is during the concept of recursion. Recursion uses stack to store data
            at every step. Thats why in an unclosed recursion, we get stack overflow error.

        <h1>Features</h1>

        <ul>
            <li>Stack is ordered list</li>
            <li>It follows <b>LIFO</b> (Last In First Out) or <b>FILO</b> (First In Last Out) order</li>
            <li><b>push()</b> function is used to insert a new element in the stack</li>
            <li><b>pop()</b> fuction is used to remove an element from the stack</li>
            <li>Both insertion and removal are allowed at only one end of Stack called Top</li>
            <li>Both insertion and removal are of order O(1) and serching is of order O(n)</li>
            <li>Stack is said to be overflow state when it is completely full</li>
        </ul>
